Description

The liri-node-app is an all in one entertainment search center! You can search and retireve information for your favorite movie, favorite song or an up coming concert of your favorite artist. You don't have to spend your time searching  and then navigating differrent websites. All you have to do is type what your looking for  and the app will retrieve the information you want! Amazing!

How it works:
start by running it in node
1. node node .\liri
2. type the command you want to search:
for Movie: movie-this
for song: spotify-this-song
for concert: concert-this 
3. type in movie, concert, or song

eg. lets say you want to get information on the movie Batman Begins. you type

node .\liri movie-this Batman Begins

Thats it!
